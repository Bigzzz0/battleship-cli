# Enhanced Battleship Game - Testing Results

## üìã Testing Summary
Date: September 22, 2025
Testing Phase: Enhanced Features Implementation

## ‚úÖ Features Successfully Implemented and Tested

### 1. Debug Mode Functionality
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: Debug mode can be toggled on/off via checkbox
- **Backend Changes**: 
  - Modified `get_game_state()` to accept `debug_mode` parameter
  - Updated API endpoint to support `?debug_mode=true`
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Updated `fetchGameState()` to use debug_mode parameter
  - Modified `DualGameBoard` component to show player ships always, AI ships only in debug mode

### 2. Single-Player Mode Firing Logic
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: Corrected firing logic for single-player mode
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Modified `take_shot()` method to handle both AI and single-player modes
  - Added proper turn validation for AI games only
  - Added `target_type` to response for clarity
- **Testing**: Single-player mode allows continuous firing without turn restrictions

### 3. Custom Ship Placement Enforcement for AI Games
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: Custom Ship Placement is now mandatory for AI games
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Modified `createNewGame()` to check for AI games and enforce custom ship placement
  - Updated Custom Ship Placement button to be disabled when AI is not enabled
  - Added visual indicator "(AI games only)" to the button
- **Testing**: When AI is enabled and user clicks "New Game", system shows message "Please place your ships before starting the game with AI!"

### 4. Player Ship Display During Gameplay
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Description**: Player's own ships are now visible on their board during gameplay
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Modified `get_game_state()` to always return `player_ships_positions`
  - Separated player and AI ship visibility logic
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Updated `DualGameBoard` component to always show player ships
  - AI ships only shown in debug mode

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Modifications
1. **app/services/game_service.py**:
   - Enhanced `get_game_state()` with debug_mode parameter
   - Improved `take_shot()` logic for single-player and AI modes
   - Added proper ship position handling

2. **app/main.py**:
   - Updated `/games/{game_id}` endpoint to accept debug_mode query parameter

### Frontend Modifications
1. **battleship-frontend/src/App.jsx**:
   - Enhanced `createNewGame()` with AI validation
   - Updated `fetchGameState()` to use debug_mode parameter
   - Modified Custom Ship Placement button behavior

2. **battleship-frontend/src/components/DualGameBoard.jsx**:
   - Updated ship visibility logic
   - Player ships always visible, AI ships only in debug mode

## üéÆ User Experience Improvements

### Game Flow for AI Games:
1. User enables AI Opponent
2. Custom Ship Placement button becomes available
3. Clicking "New Game (Random Ships)" shows message to place ships first
4. User must use Custom Ship Placement before starting AI game
5. During gameplay, player can see their own ships
6. Debug mode shows AI ships as well

### Game Flow for Single-Player:
1. User can immediately start game without AI
2. Custom Ship Placement is disabled (not needed for single-player)
3. Player can fire continuously at their own board
4. Player ships are visible during gameplay

## üöÄ All Requirements Met

- ‚úÖ Debug mode functionality implemented
- ‚úÖ Single-player firing logic corrected
- ‚úÖ Custom Ship Placement enforced for AI games only
- ‚úÖ Player ships visible during gameplay
- ‚úÖ All existing features preserved (AI difficulty levels, turn-based gameplay, etc.)

## üìù Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Enhanced user experience with clear visual indicators
- Proper error handling and validation implemented
